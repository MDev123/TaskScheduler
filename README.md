# TaskScheduler

The TaskScheduler module helps you easily manage and run multiple tasks at the same time. It's like a to-do list for your game, but way smarter. It lets you create tasks, set their priorities, track their progress, and even retry them if they fail. You can control how many tasks run at once, group them, or categorize them however you want.

# Key Features

- **Task Management:** Create tasks with custom functions and organize them into categories or groups.
- **Priorities & Dependencies:** You can set tasks to have a priority (Low, Normal, High) and also make tasks depend on other tasks.
- **Retries & Timeouts:** If a task fails, it can automatically retry based on different strategies (linear, exponential, or with random delays).
- **Throttling & Rate Limits:** Control how often tasks are allowed to run to avoid overloading your game.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** All tasks are tracked in logs so you can see what's happening and debug issues if needed.

# How it Works

- **Adding Tasks:** When you add a task, you provide a function that runs the task, set its priority, and can also add a timeout or metadata (extra info about the task).
- **Running Tasks:** Tasks can run in parallel (many at once) or in sequence (one at a time). The TaskScheduler automatically decides when to run tasks based on their priority and if they have any dependencies.
- **Task Retry System:** If a task fails, it will retry based on the strategy youâ€™ve set (try again immediately, wait longer each time, or add a random delay).
- **Throttling:** Some tasks can be "throttled," meaning they can only run after a certain amount of time has passed, which is useful for rate-limiting tasks that shouldn't run too frequently.
- **Error Handling:** If a task keeps failing after all retries, the TaskScheduler can handle it globally and log the issue.
